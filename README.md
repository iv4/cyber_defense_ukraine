## Introduction
Ukraine Cyber Defense is an educational RPG game that aims to teach essential cyber security skills in the context of a real-world scenario. The game takes place in Ukraine and focuses on various cyber missions to defend against adversarial actions. The game is designed to be both immersive and educational, offering real-world examples and interactive tasks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
3. Run the `CyberRPG_Main_Script.py` file to start the game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Colorama library for colored terminal output
- Optional: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and other hardware for more realistic mission simulations

## Gameplay
The game is menu-driven, allowing you to navigate between different cities in Ukraine, each offering unique missions. You have an inventory system to keep track of items gained during missions. Missions are designed to teach a variety of cyber security skills like WiFi sniffing, signal jamming, encryption, and more. 

### Inventory System
Players have an inventory where they can store items acquired during missions. This adds an extra layer of strategy, as some items can be useful in later missions.
